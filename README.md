### Approach
I first thought what theme will I have for the app and then created the wireframe.
I spent sometime looking for images that I can use to finalise the theme in order to have a clearer vision of the end product. Once I collected all the images, I worked on the logic to calculate if there was a win or a draw in a round. Afterwards, I created the game layout while implementing the features that I wanted in the game one by one, for example, allowing the users to choose their names and avatars in the game, and keep track who is winning using hearts. I finished the project by adding the visuals and sounds. 

### Lessons Learnt
Make sure the logic is 100% before jumping to CSS.
